command line to get server metadata

Very simple command line to make use of server metadata, especially thinking on powershell.

QvQms usage: QvQms `<options`>

    -h shows usage
    
    tasks
        -ta list all tasks
        -tf <name> find task by name
        -t <id> get task by id

    documents
        -da list all user documents
        -du list all user documents access entries
        
The idea is to increase options as needed
